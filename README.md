# Quantum vs Classical Simulation

This is a simple simulation that demonstrates the conceptual difference between how a classical computer and a quantum computer might approach problem-solving.

🧠 The simulation is entirely browser-based and written in basic python (without functions – built before I formally learned them). Despite its simplicity, it works as intended and runs on desktop browsers.

## 🧪 What It Does

The simulation presents a visual or logical contrast between classical and quantum logic. While it does **not** use actual quantum computing frameworks, it metaphorically shows how quantum superposition 
and parallelism differ from step-by-step classical processing.

---

## 🚀 How to Run It

- Download or clone the repository.
- Open `index.html` in any modern desktop browser.
- Currently not optimized for mobile devices.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, python pygame
- Runs fully in the browser

---

## 📚 What I Learned

This was one of my first python projects. I built it before learning how to use functions or modules, but it helped me:
- Understand browser-based simulations
- Explore the basics of quantum computing concepts
- Develop my curiosity and confidence to learn more

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Not mobile responsive
- Code can be improved with functions and better structure (refactoring planned)

---

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm currently transitioning into software QA, with a background in electronics and hands-on testing. This project is part of my self-driven journey to explore coding 
and computation concepts beyond the standard curriculum.
